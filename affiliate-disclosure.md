# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: November 11, 2025**

## Overview

iFeeltech Guides contains affiliate links to products and services we discuss in our articles. This page explains our affiliate relationships and how they work.

## What Are Affiliate Links?

Affiliate links are special URLs that allow us to earn a small commission when you purchase products through our links. This commission comes from the retailer, not from you—**you pay the same price** whether you use our link or go directly to the retailer.

## Our Affiliate Relationships

We may participate in affiliate programs with:

- **Ubiquiti (UniFi)** - Networking equipment
- **TP-Link** - Networking equipment  
- **Amazon Associates** - Various IT products
- Other technology vendors and retailers

When we link to products from these vendors, we may earn a commission if you make a purchase.

## How We Use Affiliate Links

### Product Recommendations

We only recommend products and services that:

- We have direct experience with, or
- Are widely recognized as quality solutions in the IT industry, or
- Are relevant to the topic being discussed

**We do not recommend products solely because they offer affiliate commissions.**

### Transparency

Affiliate links in our articles are marked with special URLs (e.g., `ifeeltech.com/go-product-name`). These redirect links:

- Make it clear when you're using an affiliate link
- Allow us to track which recommendations are helpful
- Help us maintain and improve our content

### Editorial Independence

Our affiliate relationships **do not influence** our editorial content. We:

- Provide honest assessments of products
- Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs
- Compare multiple options (including non-affiliate products)
- Focus on helping you make informed decisions

## Your Choice

Using our affiliate links is entirely optional. You can:

- Use our links to support our work (at no extra cost to you)
- Go directly to the retailer's website
- Search for products independently

**Either way, you'll pay the same price.**

## How Commissions Support Our Work

Affiliate commissions help us:

- Maintain this free resource
- Test and evaluate products
- Create detailed guides and tutorials
- Keep content updated with current information
- Cover hosting and operational costs

We do not charge for access to our guides. Affiliate commissions allow us to keep this content free and accessible.

## Price and Availability

- **Prices change:** Product prices and availability may change after publication
- **We verify pricing:** We attempt to verify prices when writing articles
- **Check current prices:** Always check the retailer's website for current pricing
- **No guarantees:** We cannot guarantee prices or product availability

## Products We Don't Recommend

We will not recommend products that:

- We believe are poor quality
- Don't serve the stated purpose well
- Have better alternatives available
- We wouldn't use ourselves

**No amount of affiliate commission will change this policy.**

## Disclosure in Articles

In addition to this page, we include disclosure statements in articles containing affiliate links:

> "This article contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission when you purchase through these links, at no additional cost to you."

## Questions About Specific Recommendations

If you have questions about why we recommended a specific product or whether a recommendation is influenced by affiliate relationships, please contact us:

- **Website:** [ifeeltech.com/contact](https://ifeeltech.com/contact)
- **Email:** Available through our contact page

We're happy to explain our reasoning and provide additional context.

## FTC Compliance

This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's requirements for affiliate relationships and endorsements. We follow FTC guidelines for:

- Clear and conspicuous disclosure
- Honest product recommendations
- Transparency about affiliate relationships

## Non-Affiliate Content

Not all product links are affiliate links. We also link to:

- Official documentation (NIST, CISA, manufacturer specs)
- Open-source projects
- Educational resources
- Industry publications

These links are provided for informational purposes and do not generate commissions.

## Changes to This Disclosure

We may update this disclosure as we add or remove affiliate relationships. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

**Summary:** We use affiliate links to support this free resource. We only recommend products we believe in. You pay the same price whether you use our links or not. Our editorial content remains independent and honest.
