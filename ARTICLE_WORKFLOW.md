# Article Creation Workflow

## Two-Pass Quality System

Every article goes through **two distinct passes** before publication to ensure accuracy and tone quality.

### 🔍 **MANDATORY: Web Search Verification**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** All pricing, statistics, and technical specifications MUST be verified through web searches before publication.

**Never approximate. Never guess. Always verify.**

- ✅ **Pricing:** Search official vendor sites for exact current prices
- ✅ **Statistics:** Find and verify original sources for all claims
- ✅ **Technical specs:** Confirm specifications from manufacturer documentation
- ✅ **Date everything:** Include "as of [Month Year]" for all time-sensitive information
- ✅ **Multiple attempts:** If first search fails, try different queries
- ✅ **Take the time:** Accuracy is more important than speed

## Phase 1: Content Creation

### Step 1: Analyze Pillar Article
**AI Action:**
- Read the provided pillar article URL
- Identify key themes, data points, and insights
- Note any statistics, pricing, or technical specifications
- Understand target audience and search intent

**Output:** Deep understanding of pillar content

---

### Step 2: Suggest Supporting Topics
**AI Action:**
- Generate 2-3 supporting topic options
- Each option should:
  - Complement the pillar article
  - Address a specific user question
  - Provide unique value
  - Be searchable and relevant

**User Action:** Select preferred topic

---

### Step 3: Write First Draft
**AI Action:**
- Write complete ~1,000-word article
- Follow CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md structure
- Include 1-3 internal links to pillar
- Add 1 external authority link
- **REQUIRED:** Include at least ONE table (comparison, features, specs, etc.)
- **REQUIRED:** Include at least ONE bullet list section (steps, criteria, tips)
- Use blockquotes for key insights
- Vary formatting: No more than 3-4 paragraphs without visual break
- Select relevant Unsplash featured image

**Focus:** Content quality, structure, helpfulness, scannability

**DO NOT finalize yet** - this is draft only

---

## Phase 2: Quality Verification (CRITICAL)

### Step 4: Fact-Checking Pass

**AI performs systematic verification:**

#### A. Pricing Verification (MANDATORY WEB SEARCH)

**CRITICAL: Never write pricing without verification**

**Step-by-step process:**
1. **Identify all pricing claims** in the article
2. **Perform web search** for each product/service mentioned
3. **Use specific search queries:**
   - `[product name] official price store.[vendor].com`
   - `[product] pricing 2025 site:[vendor].com`
   - `[product] cost specifications [year]`
4. **Read official vendor pages** to get exact current pricing
5. **If first search fails,** try alternative queries or check multiple retailers
6. **Document the date:** Always include "as of November 2025"

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] **Web search performed** for EVERY price mentioned
- [ ] Exact figures obtained from official sources (not approximations)
- [ ] Multiple sources checked if official site unavailable
- [ ] Date included: "as of November 2025"
- [ ] Price ranges used only when prices genuinely vary by configuration

**Examples:**

❌ **WRONG - Approximation:**
- "QuickBooks Online costs around $400 annually"
- "The UNVR is approximately $300"

✅ **CORRECT - Verified exact pricing:**
- "QuickBooks Online Simple Start costs $30/month ($360 annually as of November 2025)"
- "The UNVR costs $299 (as of November 2025, from store.ui.com)"

✅ **CORRECT - Verified range when appropriate:**
- "QuickBooks Online plans range from $30-$200 monthly depending on features (as of November 2025)"

#### B. Statistics & Claims (MANDATORY WEB SEARCH)

**CRITICAL: Never cite statistics without verification**

**Step-by-step process:**
1. **Identify all statistics** and claims in the article
2. **Perform web search** for each statistic
3. **Use specific search queries:**
   - `[statistic] [organization name] study 2024 2025`
   - `[percentage] [topic] research report`
   - `[claim] source site:[authoritative-domain].com`
4. **Find original source** - Don't cite secondary sources
5. **Verify the date** of the study/research
6. **If source is 3+ years old,** either find newer data or note the age

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] **Web search performed** for EVERY statistic
- [ ] Original source identified and verified
- [ ] Study date confirmed and included
- [ ] Link to authoritative source added
- [ ] Old statistics (3+ years) either updated or contextualized

**Examples:**

❌ **WRONG - Unverified claim:**
- "Studies show 80% of businesses experience data breaches"
- "Most companies use MFA"

✅ **CORRECT - Verified with source:**
- "Microsoft's 2023 research shows that MFA blocks 99.9% of automated credential-based attacks"
- "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center reported losses exceeding $68 million from SIM swapping in 2021"

✅ **CORRECT - Noting age of data:**
- "While 2021 FBI data showed $68 million in losses, SIM swapping attacks have continued to increase"

#### C. Technical Accuracy (MANDATORY WEB SEARCH)

**CRITICAL: Verify all technical specifications**

**Step-by-step process:**
1. **Identify all technical specs** (camera counts, storage, RAID, etc.)
2. **Perform web search** for official documentation
3. **Use specific search queries:**
   - `[product] technical specifications site:[manufacturer].com`
   - `[product] datasheet official`
   - `[product] [spec] compatibility 2025`
4. **Read official tech specs** or documentation
5. **Verify current features** - Don't assume old info is still accurate
6. **Test ALL links** mentioned in the article

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] **Web search performed** for technical specifications
- [ ] Official documentation found and verified
- [ ] Camera counts, storage capacities verified from manufacturer
- [ ] RAID configurations confirmed accurate
- [ ] Compatibility details checked
- [ ] All links tested and working

**Examples:**

❌ **WRONG - Unverified specs:**
- "The UNVR supports up to 20 cameras"
- "It has 5 drive bays"

✅ **CORRECT - Verified from official source:**
- "The UNVR supports up to 18 4K cameras or 60 Full HD cameras (per Ubiquiti official specs)"
- "The UNVR has 4 drive bays, while the UNVR Pro has 7 drive bays"

#### D. Integration & Feature Counts (USE WITH CAUTION)

**Problem:** Integration counts change frequently and are hard to verify

**Best practices:**
- [ ] **Avoid specific counts** unless recently verified: "650+ integrations"
- [ ] Use descriptive terms: "extensive," "hundreds," "robust ecosystem"
- [ ] Focus on capabilities rather than exact numbers
- [ ] If using counts, add date: "over 600 integrations as of November 2025"
- [ ] **Perform web search** if specific count is critical to the article

**Examples:**

❌ **WRONG - Outdated specific count:**
- "QuickBooks has 650+ integrations"
- "Xero connects to 1,000 apps"

✅ **CORRECT - Descriptive without specific count:**
- "QuickBooks maintains an extensive integration ecosystem with hundreds of applications"
- "Xero offers robust third-party integrations covering most business needs"

✅ **ACCEPTABLE - If recently verified:**
- "QuickBooks Online lists over 650 integrations in its app marketplace (as of November 2025)"

---

### Step 5: Tone & Language Review

**AI performs second pass for tone issues:**

#### A. Check for Sensational Language

**Scan for and remove:**
- ❌ "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "shocking," "incredible"
- ❌ "You MUST," "Never do this," "Always use"
- ❌ "The ultimate solution," "The only way"
- ❌ "Shocking truth," "Secret that [industry] doesn't want you to know"
- ❌ Excessive exclamation points!!!

**Replace with:**
- ✅ "Effective," "practical," "recommended," "worth considering"
- ✅ "You can," "consider," "may want to," "often works well"
- ✅ "One approach," "A common solution," "Many businesses find"

#### B. Check for Fear-Mongering

**Remove:**
- ❌ "Your business will fail if..."
- ❌ "You're at serious risk of..."
- ❌ "This could destroy your..."
- ❌ False urgency: "Act now before it's too late"

**Replace with:**
- ✅ "Businesses that don't address this may face..."
- ✅ "This presents risks including..."
- ✅ "Consider addressing this to avoid..."

#### C. Verify Helpful Tone

**Ensure article:**
- ✅ Presents options rather than mandates
- ✅ Acknowledges trade-offs and limitations
- ✅ Respects reader intelligence
- ✅ Provides actionable information
- ✅ Answers the actual question being asked

#### D. Check for Absolute Statements

**Soften absolutes:**
- ❌ "This is the best solution"
- ❌ "Everyone should do this"
- ❌ "This never works"

**Replace with:**
- ✅ "This is often an effective solution"
- ✅ "Many businesses benefit from this approach"
- ✅ "This approach has limitations in certain scenarios"

## AI Self-Check Questions

Before finalizing any article, AI should ask:

1. **Accuracy:** Have I verified all facts, prices, and statistics?
2. **Tone:** Would this pass a "sensationalism detector"?
3. **Helpfulness:** Does this genuinely help the reader make decisions?
4. **Nuance:** Have I acknowledged trade-offs and limitations?
5. **Evergreen:** Will this information still be accurate in 6 months?
6. **Authority:** Are my sources credible and current?
7. **Intent:** Does this answer what the user is actually searching for?

If any answer is "no" or "unsure," revise before saving.
